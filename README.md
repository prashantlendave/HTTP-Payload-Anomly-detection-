## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Train_data.csv** â€“ Contains labeled HTTP payloads for training.
- **Test_data.csv** â€“ Contains payloads for evaluating model performance.

Each row contains:
- `payload`: raw HTTP payload (string)
- `label`: 0 (normal) or 1 (anomalous)

## ðŸ§  Models

### 1. LSTM (Without Attention)
A basic sequential model using a bidirectional LSTM layer followed by dense layers for classification.

### 2. LSTM with Bahdanau Attention
Enhances the LSTM with an attention mechanism to weigh hidden states before classification.

### 3. Transformer
Applies self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in payload sequences. Based on the original Transformer encoder architecture.
